**Project Title:** ResumeRevamp - AI-Powered Resume Updater

**Objective:**

Create a web-based application that allows users to upload their existing resumes, which are then analyzed using OpenAI's natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. The application will update the resume based on a job description provided by the user, highlighting relevant skills and experiences that match the job requirements.

**Features:**

1. **Resume Upload:** Allow users to upload their existing resumes in various formats (e.g., PDF, Word Doc, Text).
2. **Job Description Input:** Provide a text input field where users can enter the job description they're applying for.
3. **OpenAI Integration:** Utilize OpenAI's NLP capabilities to analyze the uploaded resume and job description, identifying relevant skills and experiences that match the job requirements.
4. **Resume Update:** Generate an updated version of the user's resume based on the analysis, highlighting the most relevant information.
5. **Preview Mode:** Allow users to preview the updated resume before downloading it.
6. **Download Option:** Provide a button to download the updated resume in Word Document format (`.docx`).

**Design Requirements:**

1. User-friendly interface with clear labels and minimal navigation.
2. Resume upload area should be easily accessible and allow for multiple file formats.
3. Job description input field should have character count limits and auto-save functionality.
4. Preview mode should display the updated resume in a readable format, allowing users to review changes before downloading.

**Technical Requirements:**

1. Back-end programming language: Choose a suitable programming language (e.g., Node.js, Python) and framework (e.g., Express, Django) for building the application.
2. OpenAI integration: Use OpenAI's API (currently available in Beta) to perform NLP analysis on the uploaded resume and job description.
3. Resume updating logic: Develop algorithms to analyze the resume and job description, identifying relevant skills and experiences that match the job requirements.
4. Front-end framework: Choose a front-end framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) for building the user interface.

**Additional Considerations:**

1. **Security:** Ensure the application handles sensitive user data securely by implementing proper encryption, password hashing, and access controls.
2. **Accessibility:** Design the application to be accessible on various devices and browsers, adhering to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
3. **Scalability:** Plan for scalability and high-traffic handling by using load balancing, caching, and efficient database querying.
